# Custom-Image-Classifier
This is a custom hand written image classifier written in python using Tensorflow.
in this project of mine we can actually make an gray scale image in photoshop or in any photo editor software,
then we just need to give that image into my .py file with some correct parameters then we will run this image classifier model
and train it then it can identify your image at the end after training.it is giving the accuracy approx 89%-90% and that is enough i think
for a beginner level.
i used some well written api code and some lines of code directly from the internet but the main key concept of giving our custom modified image
idea is completly mine.
